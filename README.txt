Three most important files:
1. "models/sequence/sentiword.py": contains all functions of language representations models
and neural network models. You can find most of the part of our work in this file. Just open 
the files in an IDE, such as Spyder and run the script line-by-line. 

Warning! You have to change the file path to the directory where you save the datasets. Two 
datasets are used, named combined.csv and DJIA.csv


2. "models/sequence/preprocess.py": contains word embedding functions

3. "models/sequence/preprocess.py": contains word embedding functions
